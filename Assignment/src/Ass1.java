3.  Launch the Eclipse IDE & Create a Workspace
	Create a new Project

	Create a new Class

4. Selenium doesn't have everything, there are more external libraries with packeges or jars. 
	Selenium needs these drivers to run.

5. One of these two: We need to add external jars and import org.openqa.selenium.ie.InternetExplorerDriver  

6. close(): closes the current browser and quit(): closes driver.

7. ChromeDriver driver = new ChromeDriver(); runs only Chrome.
